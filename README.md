## Project Overview

This app was created for the Hack Reactor Front End Capstone project.
The objective was to deliver a fully functional web application for an e-commerce website. Our team worked together on a single code base by dividing up the widgets, but working collaboratively to produce a single front end application powered by React and Redux. The user is able to interact with the product page for any given item. This includes the ability to look at product photos, browse related products, and read customer questions and reviews.
